    <p>
      I am currently a software developer at a Warwick based network infrastructure provider called telent. I work in the R&D Agile software development team.
      My daily duties include developing software for various company contracts as well as internally used applications. The scope of this software ranges from
      government infrastructure asset management software to internal applications and asset monitoring pieces. I am the most junior member of the team at the
      time of writing however I attend to a consistent level of personal-professional development in hopes to continue on my career path.
